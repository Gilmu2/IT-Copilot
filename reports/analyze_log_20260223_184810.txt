## Log Overview
This is an Intune Management Extension (IME) log from a Windows device, showing proactive remediation/detection script executions, proxy polling/SideCar gateway usage, and Win32 app check-in activity. Pre-scan indicates 200 lines with 5 errors and 0 warnings; the visible excerpt spans 2-3-2026 from 14:57:46 to 15:38:00.

## Detected Patterns and Anomalies
Authentication
- Successful token acquisition for “Work or school account” appears multiple times, indicating auth is generally working:
  - “Successfully get the token with client id fc0f3af4-6835-4174-b806-f7db311fd2f3 and resource id 26a4ae64-5862-427f-a9b0-044e62572a4f”
  - Also seen for resource id “00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000” (15:33:48.3807400)

Policy / Script execution
- Multiple remediation detection scripts executed via agentexecutor with exit code 0 (success):
  - “Powershell execution is done, exitCode = 0” (repeats at 14:57:54, 14:58:06, 14:58:18, 14:58:30)
- Tamper validation repeatedly skipped due to unsupported script type:
  - “ Tamper validation skipped - unsupported script type 8.” (e.g., 14:57:46.4742380; 14:57:59.5009248; 14:58:11.2730212; 14:58:23.5693440)

Connectivity
- SideCar/TrafficGateway proxy usage is configured and network requests are succeeding in this excerpt:
  - “Sending network request... Current proxy is https://agents.amsub0502.manage.microsoft.com/...”
  - “Succeeded, client-request-id: ...” (e.g., 15:25:33.1015462; 15:35:10.6877840; 15:35:15.5494999; 15:37:45.9028429)
- Pre-scan flags “timeout” as suspicious; in the shown lines it appears as output file paths (e.g., “...PreDetectScript.timeout”) rather than an explicit timeout failure message.

Resource / Power state
- Device enters/leaves connected standby and session lock/unlock events occur:
  - “LowPowerEpoch event details updated. EnteringConnectedStandby: True” (15:09:31.2336318)
  - “EnteringConnectedStandby: False” (15:12:12.5262776)
  - “OnSessionChange: SessionLock” / “SessionUnlock”

Other
- Co-management feature query fails but is explicitly marked not fatal (repeats):
  - “co-mgt features is not available, ex = System.Management.ManagementException, not fatal”
- Repeated flighting key lookups falling back to defaults (informational/no failure indicated):
  - “Key: DisableV2ChainValidation, value not found. Falling back to default value: False.”
  - “Key: 4CF8C6F4-C96E-4454-A6D0-196EAAC3E496, value not found. Falling back to default value: False.”

## Severity Assessment
Overall: Medium. Pre-scan reports 5 errors and a suspicious “timeout” pattern, but the visible excerpt shows successful script runs and successful network check-ins; the main notable issues are non-fatal management exceptions and tamper validation being skipped.

Top 3 most severe individual events
1. Medium: Suspicious “timeout” pattern flagged in pre-scan (no explicit timeout failure line visible in excerpt; appears as “...PreDetectScript.timeout” file path in agentexecutor command lines).
2. Medium: “co-mgt features is not available, ex = System.Management.ManagementException, not fatal” (repeated; could indicate WMI/provider access issues though not impacting IME check-in here).
3. Low: “ Tamper validation skipped - unsupported script type 8.” (repeated; reduces a validation step for those scripts but does not show execution failure).

## Escalation Recommendations
Immediate escalation to human
- Escalate if the pre-scan “error_count: 5” corresponds to actual failed check-ins/app deployments/remediations (not present in the excerpt) or if there are real script/app timeouts (beyond the “*.timeout” filename usage).

Can wait / schedule follow-up
- Investigate repeated “co-mgt features is not available...ManagementException” if co-management is expected on this device, or if other management components are experiencing WMI-related issues.

Informational only
- Flighting keys “value not found, falling back to default” messages.
- Power/session lock/unlock transitions.
- Successful proxy polling and successful SideCar gateway web requests.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Locate the 5 error entries referenced by the pre-scan (search the full 200-line set for type=”3”, “error”, “failed”, “exception”, “timeout”, or non-zero exit codes) and identify the exact failing component (remediation, Win32 app, check-in, or connectivity).
2. Validate whether any remediation detection/remediation actually timed out (look for explicit timeout handling/results), versus the presence of “*.timeout” output file paths in the agentexecutor invocation.
3. If co-management should be enabled, capture details around the “System.Management.ManagementException” occurrences (timestamps and surrounding lines) and verify WMI health on the endpoint (since IME is querying co-mgt features).
4. Confirm Win32 app workflow status in the full log around the “InProgressDownloadCompleted” state:
   - “ ... enforcement state: InProgressDownloadCompleted”
5. If tamper validation is required for your security posture, review which script types are being executed as “type 8” and whether those should be converted/packaged differently to support tamper validation (as indicated by the repeated “Tamper validation skipped” messages).
