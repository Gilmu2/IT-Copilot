## Compliance Analysis
- Overall compliance rate: 190/500 devices compliant (38%)
- Non-compliance rate: 270/500 devices non-compliant (54%)
- Unknown compliance: 40/500 devices (8%)
- OS-specific non-compliance signal:
  - “top_non_compliant_os” indicates Windows accounts for 270 non-compliant devices (i.e., the entire non-compliant population is Windows per the snapshot).
- Gaps identified from the snapshot data:
  - Compliance issues are concentrated on Windows (270 non-compliant Windows devices).
  - Unknown compliance exists (40 devices) but the snapshot does not attribute unknown to OS; this represents a visibility/assessment gap regardless of platform.

## Configuration Coverage
Policies/configurations present (by name patterns in the snapshot):
- Update management / patch rings:
  - Extensive Windows Autopatch ring policies for standard Windows and for AVD/VDI variants:
    - Windows Autopatch - Test/Ring1/Ring2/Ring3/Last
    - Windows Autopatch- AVD - Test/Ring1/Ring2/Last
    - Windows Autopatch- VDI - Test/Ring1/Ring2/Ring3/Last
  - CP_Update_policy is also present.
- Security hardening / endpoint protection:
  - AppLocker Policy - Block Browsers
  - Edge policy to block use of browsers where Purview DLP protections for unmanaged AI apps don’t apply
  - Multiple “Defender - …” policies (Accessibility, Background services, Bluetooth permissions, Full Disk Access, Microsoft AutoUpdate, Network Filter, Notifcations)
  - Off Board Defender
- Enrollment / management behavior:
  - MDM Wins Over GPO
  - Skip User ESP during Windows Autopilot Enrollment
- Restrictions / device controls:
  - CP_DeviceRestriction
  - Prevent User Change Lan Configurations
- Tagging / grouping indicators:
  - Defender Group Tag - ChatGPT
  - Defender Group Tag - Products - R&D
- Telemetry:
  - Intune Telemetry Data Collection
- Identity/SSO (iOS-specific):
  - iOS: Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in

Appears missing or under-covered (based only on what is/not listed):
- Non-Windows platform coverage is minimal in the named configuration set:
  - Only one explicitly iOS policy is listed (Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in).
  - No Linux-specific policy names are present in the provided policy list.
  - macOS appears only indirectly via some “Defender - …” naming and a macOS Office suite app type, but there are no clearly macOS-specific configuration policy names in the provided list.
- Compliance posture is poor (270 non-compliant) despite many Windows Autopatch ring policies existing; this suggests either:
  - Policies are not effectively assigned to all Windows devices, or
  - Non-compliance is driven by other control areas not visible in the snapshot (e.g., compliance policies not represented here), or
  - Devices are failing policy/application prerequisites—cannot be confirmed from the snapshot, but the mismatch is a coverage/assignment risk to investigate.

## App Deployment Status
- App portfolio is heavily Windows-centric:
  - win32LobApp: 137/155 (88.4%)
- Mobile and macOS presence is limited:
  - iosStoreApp: 15
  - managedIOSLobApp: 1
  - androidStoreApp: 1
  - macOSOfficeSuiteApp: 1
Potential deployment gaps inferred from the snapshot:
- macOS: 5 devices exist, but only 1 macOSOfficeSuiteApp is listed; no other macOS app types are present in the breakdown.
- Linux: 21 devices exist, but there are no Linux app types shown in the breakdown.
- Android: an androidStoreApp count exists (1), but the OS breakdown does not list Android devices; this may indicate unused assignments, stale catalog entries, or preparation work not reflected in enrolled devices.
- iOS: iOS app presence (15 iosStoreApp + 1 managedIOSLobApp) exists, but iOS device counts are not provided in the OS breakdown; validate whether iOS devices are included elsewhere or whether iOS apps are maintained without active device population.

## Findings and Recommendations
1. Address high Windows non-compliance (270 non-compliant Windows devices out of 474 Windows total).
   - Recommendation: Perform a targeted Windows compliance failure analysis for the 270 devices (review Intune compliance policy results, remediation reasons, and assignment scope). Prioritize by ring (Test/Ring1/Ring2/Ring3/Last) and by device grouping if available.

2. Reduce “Unknown” compliance state (40 devices).
   - Recommendation: Investigate the 40 unknown devices for enrollment/last check-in issues (e.g., devices not reporting, stale records). Enforce reporting cadence and retire or remediate inactive device objects as appropriate.

3. Validate policy assignment effectiveness for the Windows Autopatch ring policies.
   - Data point: Multiple Windows Autopatch policies exist (standard, AVD, and VDI variants across Test/Ring1/Ring2/Ring3/Last), yet Windows non-compliance is 270.
   - Recommendation: Confirm that the Autopatch ring policies and CP_Update_policy are assigned to the intended Windows populations (including exclusions), and verify there is no ring overlap or mis-targeting causing update/non-compliance drift.

4. Review endpoint security policy coherence around browser blocking and AI/DLP controls.
   - Data point: “AppLocker Policy - Block Browsers” and “Edge policy to block use of browsers where Purview DLP protections for unmanaged AI apps don’t apply” both exist.
   - Recommendation: Validate the intended user/device scope and ensure these controls are not causing unintended productivity impact or conflicting enforcement across managed/unmanaged browser scenarios.

5. Confirm Defender policy scope and lifecycle controls.
   - Data point: Multiple “Defender - …” policies exist and “Off Board Defender” exists.
   - Recommendation: Verify “Off Board Defender” is tightly scoped (break-glass or decommission workflows only) and does not overlap with active populations. Review assignment of “Defender - …” policies to ensure consistent coverage and to reduce configuration fragmentation.

6. Close platform coverage gaps for non-Windows devices (Linux 21, macOS 5).
   - Data point: No Linux-specific policy names and limited macOS-specific policy names are present in the configuration list.
   - Recommendation: Identify whether Linux and macOS devices are in-scope for management; if yes, define and deploy platform-appropriate configuration baselines and ensure they are represented as dedicated, trackable policy objects.

7. Rationalize application catalog relative to device population.
   - Data point: 1 androidStoreApp exists while Android devices are not listed in OS breakdown; iOS app types exist without iOS appearing in OS breakdown.
   - Recommendation: Reconcile app inventory with enrolled device platforms. Remove/retire unused app entries or document future platform rollout plans; ensure app assignments match current device populations to reduce administrative overhead and deployment noise.

8. Reassess the balance of Win32 LOB apps (137) vs. other app delivery methods.
   - Data point: 137/155 apps are win32LobApp.
   - Recommendation: Review packaging/maintenance burden and standardize where possible (e.g., consolidate overlapping packages, validate detection rules). Tie key Win32 app deployments to compliance outcomes if app presence is required for compliance in your environment.

9. Validate device restriction posture and network configuration controls.
   - Data point: “CP_DeviceRestriction” and “Prevent User Change Lan Configurations” exist.
   - Recommendation: Confirm these restrictions align with the causes of Windows non-compliance (270). If restrictions contribute to non-compliance (e.g., required settings failing), prioritize remediation of configuration conflicts or prerequisites on affected devices.
