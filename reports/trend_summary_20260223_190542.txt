Trend | Insight | Suggested Action
---|---|---
High non-compliance rate | 270 of 500 devices are non-compliant, exceeding the 190 compliant devices (with 40 in unknown state). | Review the top failing compliance policies for Windows and remediate (or adjust) the specific settings causing the bulk of non-compliance.
Windows-heavy fleet driving issues | Windows accounts for 474 of 500 devices, and all reported non-compliance is on Windows (270). | Prioritize Windows compliance troubleshooting (update rings, security baselines/Defender, device restrictions) and validate assignment scope/targeting for Windows policies.
Windows-centric app and policy footprint | Apps are predominantly Win32 (137 of 155) and the configuration set includes many Windows Autopatch update rings/policies, indicating most management effort is Windows-focused. | Rationalize and standardize Windows update/app deployment (reduce overlapping rings/policies where possible) and validate Win32 app deployment/requirements to minimize conflicts affecting compliance.

Executive Summary: The environment is overwhelmingly Windows-focused, and Windows devices account for all recorded non-compliance, so prioritizing Windows compliance remediation and simplifying overlapping Windows policy/app deployments should yield the fastest improvement.
