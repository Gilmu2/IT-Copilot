Trend | Insight | Suggested Action
---|---|---
High non-compliance rate | 5,451 of 10,000 devices are non-compliant, exceeding the 3,860 compliant devices (689 are unknown). | Prioritize remediation by reviewing the top failing compliance policies and enforcing targeted fix actions (update/Defender/config baselines) for non-compliant devices.
Windows-driven non-compliance | Windows makes up 9,498 of 10,000 devices and accounts for 5,450 of the 5,451 non-compliant devices. | Focus compliance troubleshooting and policy tuning on Windows first (validate Autopatch rings, update policies, and key Windows configuration profiles) to get the biggest compliance lift.
Win32 app-heavy environment | Of 155 apps, 137 are Win32 LOB apps, indicating a strong dependency on Windows application deployment vs. relatively few apps for other platforms. | Review Win32 app packaging/deployment health (detection rules, supersedence, assignment targeting) and align app deployment with compliance requirements for Windows devices.

Executive Summary: The environment is overwhelmingly Windows-centric, and non-compliance is both high and almost entirely driven by Windows devices, within a deployment posture dominated by Win32 line-of-business apps.
